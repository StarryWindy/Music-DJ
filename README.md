# MusicDJ recreated

Finally, the app is ready for a public beta. It took me around 2 weeks, but we're here.

## Features
* Create songs using the original samples
* You can export the songs to the .wav format
* You can save the project you're working on for later

## To be added
* Higher quality samples
* MIDI player
* Tempo changer

## How to download
At the moment, this is an Android and Windows only app. Apple's policy makes me unable to release on IOS. If you want a linux version, let me know.

* [Android](https://github.com/pattlebass/Music-Dj/releases/latest/download/MusicDJ.apk)
* [Windows](https://github.com/pattlebass/Music-Dj/releases/latest/download/MusicDJ.zip)

You might get warnings about this app not being safe. Like [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlLiX.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/VlnKgTB.png). That's because I'm not a verified publisher and there is nothing I can do at the moment.

On Android, you'll need to allow apps from unknown sources. If you don't know how to do that, search a tutorial for your specific Android version.

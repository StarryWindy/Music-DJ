# MusicDJ recreated

Finally, the app is ready for a public beta. It took me around 2 weeks, but we're here.

## Features
* Create songs using the original samples
* You can export the songs to the .wav format
* You can save the project you're working on for later

## To be added
* Higher quality samples
* MIDI player
* Tempo changer
* Actually opening the saved project (it currently doesn't work)

## How to download
At the moment, this is an Android and Windows only app. Apple's policy makes me unable to release on IOS. If you want a linux version, let me know.

## GDScript style guide
It's basically [this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) but with a few changes.

### Summary 
1. Use snake_case for variable names, functions and signals.
2. Signals should be at the past tense.
3. Nodes, classes and file names should use PascalCase.
4. Use 2 newlines between functions, unless they are short.
5. Use static typing as much as you can.
